# Programming Paradigms
Paradigm can also be termed as method to solve some problem or do some task.
There are lots for programming language that are known but **all of them need to follow some strategy** when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is **paradigms**.

# Imperative programming paradigm
It is one of the oldest programming paradigm
It is based on Von Neumann architecture.

It works by **changing the program state** through assignment statements.
It performs step by step task by changing state.
The paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all the result is stored.
Disadvantage:
- Complex problem cannot be solved

- Less efficient and less productive

- Parallel programming is not possible

Examples of Imperative programming paradigm:
- C : developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson
- Fortran : developed by John Backus for IBM
- Basic : developed by John G Kemeny and Thomas E Kurtz



```C
int marks[5] = { 12, 32, 45, 13, 19 } int sum = 0;

float average = 0.0;

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    sum = sum + marks[i];

}

average = sum / 5;
```



## Procedural programming paradigm
This paradigm emphasizes on **procedure** in terms of under lying machine model.

Examples of Procedural programming paradigm:

- C : developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson

- C++ : developed by Bjarne Stroustrup

- Java : developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems

- ColdFusion : developed by J J Allaire

- Pascal : developed by Niklaus Wirth
