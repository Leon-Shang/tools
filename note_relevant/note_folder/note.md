POSIX first was a standard in 1988 long before the Single UNIX Specification. It was one of the attempts at unifying all the various UNIX forks and UNIX-like systems.
 The first standard POSIX.1 is formally known as IEEE std 1003.1-1988.[1] IEEE charged a substantial fee to obtain a copy of the standard.
The Open Group released the Single UNIX Specification (SUSv2) in 1997 based on IEEE's work of the POSIX standard. SUSv3 was released in 2001 from a joint working group between IEEE and The Open Group known as the Austin Group. SUSv3 is also known as POSIX:2001[2]. There is now also POSIX:2004 and POSIX:2008 which is the core of SUSv4.

 Therefore, any software that conforms to POSIX standards should be compatible with other operating systems that adhere to the POSIX standards.
For that reason, most of the tools we use on Linux and Unix-like operating systems behave almost the same. For example, if we use the ps command, it should behave the same under OpenBSD, Debian, and macOS.
2.2. POSIX Versions
The family of standards that POSIX refers to is known as IEEE Std 1003.n-yyyy. The n can be replaced with the version number such as IEEE Std 1003.1. We can also refer to the IEEE Std 1003.1 as POSIX.1. The current version of POSIX.1 is IEEE Std 1003.1-2017.
POSIX 1003.1 is the base standard upon which the POSIX family of standards has been developed, and there are currently more than 20 standards and drafts under the POSIX umbrella.
On the other hand, POSIX.2 describes the command interpreter, portable shell programming, user environment, and related utilities. Both standards are strongly influenced by existing UNIX practice and experience.
